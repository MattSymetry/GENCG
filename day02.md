# Day 02 - Grids

I first searched for inspiration on the internet. Then I started to create a grid out of cubes. Those cubes I then stretched to create different heights.
Then I positioned the camera at an isometric point of view and changed it to an orthographic projection to create that look.
I used my own shader material so I could set a color for each side of the cube.

For the interactive animations I found the Tween.js library. (Hover/Touche over the cubes to interact)

After that, I tried to create some random isometric objects. (Reload page to get a new one)
