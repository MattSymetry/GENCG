# Day 03 - Clock / Time

Todays theme was clock/passing of time. I still was very much into the isometric artstyle from yesterday, so I knew I wanted to do some isometric work again.
I quickly realized that I wanted to create some sort of abstract clock that was still readable.
So, I started by creating a wall out of cubes. Then I wanted to simply create some sort of digital clock. But since that wouldnt be very abstract, I brainstormed and tried out some different ideas until i came up with the final way of showing the digits.

To read the clock, you have to count the cubes on the wall. A number consists of two columns of blocks, the first showing the tens digit, the second the ones digit.
The first block on the far left is the hour number. After the " : " follow the minutes, and on the far right the seconds.
