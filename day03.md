# Day 03 - Clock / Time

To get some ideas on how to visualize the passage of time, I first looked at some inspiration from class documentation and also on Pinterest.
I quickly realized that I wanted to create some sort of abstrong clock that was still readable.
Yesterday I created some isometric art, which can also be very abstract. So I decided to create an abstract clock in an isometric view.

To read the clock, you have to count the cubes on the wall. A number consists of two columns of blocks, the first showing the tens digit, the second the ones digit.
The first block on the far left is the hour number. After the " : " follow the minutes, and on the far right the seconds.
