# Day 05 - Drawing with gravity

By reflecting and looking back on all the projects I've done in the past few days, i really enjoyed the idea of a drawing machine, but this time, letting the machine do all the work insted of drawing yourself.

I created a stationary big planet in the center of the scene. Now, I spawn in some random sized plantes at random positions around that stationary planet. Then I just "simulate" the paths of the planets according to the gravitational interactiones between all planets and draw out the paths as lines.
