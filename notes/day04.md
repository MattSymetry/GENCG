# Day 04 - Drawing machine

Todays theme is drawin machines. I started to think about how it would be possible to draw in 3D space. So I came up with the idea of flying around in first person view, and being able to leave behinde a path. 

So you can now fly inside a 50x50x50 cube. You constantly move forward. You can use WASD to fly rotate UP/DOW/LEFT/RIGHT. While pressing the space bar, you create the path.

On the left half of the screen, you can see the first person view in which you are drawing. On the rigth side, you can see the artwork from a stationary camera, which can be moved around with orbit conrol. (The performance might not be the best, sorry for that :/ )
