# Generative Computer Graphics - Fall 2022


## Intro

This is the documentation of the `generative computer graphics` class of Mattia Metry.
Here you can find all the small projects I made during this class. Most of them are just sort of proof of concepts and in no way or form a final product. The projects are a nice starting point for future work.
